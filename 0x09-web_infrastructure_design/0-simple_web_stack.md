Description:

This depiction illustrates a fundamental web infrastructure responsible for hosting a website that is accessible via the domain www.foobar.com. The setup lacks firewalls and SSL certificates, thereby leaving the server's network vulnerable. Each component within the infrastructure, including the database and application server, relies on shared resources such as CPU, RAM, and SSD storage provided by the single server.

Specifics About This Infrastructure:

Server Definition:

A server, whether in the form of hardware or software, acts as a provider of services to other computers, commonly referred to as clients. It facilitates the exchange of information and resources across a network.

Role of the Domain Name:

The domain name serves as a user-friendly alias for an IP Address. Instead of remembering complex numerical addresses, users can easily access websites using recognizable domain names. The IP-address-to-domain-name mapping is orchestrated by the Domain Name System (DNS).

DNS Record for www.foobar.com:

The DNS record for www.foobar.com utilizes an A record, also known as an Address Mapping record. This record type establishes a correspondence between a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address, allowing users to access the website using the recognizable domain name.

Function of the Web Server:

The web server, operating either as software or hardware, handles incoming requests via HTTP or the secure HTTPS protocol. It then furnishes the requested content to users or generates error messages when necessary.

Role of the Application Server:

The application server's purpose is to manage, deploy, and host various applications and associated services. It facilitates the delivery of sophisticated consumer or business applications to users, enabling them to interact with dynamic content.

Purpose of the Database:

The database serves as a repository for structured information that can be effortlessly accessed, managed, and updated. It underpins the storage and retrieval of data critical to the website's functionality.

Client-Server Communication:

Communication between the server (hosting the website) and the client (user's computer) transpires over the internet network, facilitated by the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite. This suite of protocols ensures reliable and accurate data exchange.

Issues With This Infrastructure:

Single Points of Failure (SPOF):

Numerous vulnerabilities arise due to single points of failure. For instance, the MySQL database server's unavailability would lead to the entire website becoming inaccessible. Lack of redundancy amplifies the impact of such failures.

Downtime During Maintenance:

Routine maintenance necessitates the temporary suspension of services or even the entire server. Since the infrastructure operates with a solitary server, any maintenance efforts result in website downtime, adversely affecting user experience.

Scaling Challenges:

Scaling the infrastructure to accommodate heightened incoming traffic poses a challenge. With all critical components residing on a single server, resource limitations can impede the server's ability to handle increased demand, leading to performance degradation.
