Description:
Outlined here is a meticulously devised web infrastructure employing three servers, characterized by heightened security, vigilant monitoring, and the provision of encrypted traffic.

Insights Into This Infrastructure:

Role of Firewalls:
Firewalls play a pivotal role in safeguarding the network, particularly the web servers, against unwarranted and unauthorized access. They function as intermediaries between the internal and external networks, blocking incoming traffic that meets predefined criteria indicative of potential threats.

Significance of SSL Certificate:
The SSL certificate serves as a linchpin for encrypting traffic traversing between the web servers and the external network. This encryption strategy mitigates the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and interception by network sniffers. By establishing a secure communication channel, SSL certificates bolster privacy, integrity, and authentication.

Purpose of Monitoring Clients:
Monitoring clients assume the pivotal task of overseeing the health and performance of both servers and the external network. These clients diligently scrutinize server operations, gauge overall performance metrics, and promptly alert administrators when deviations from expected behavior arise. Employing a monitoring tool, administrators gain insights into server operations, including accessibility testing, response time measurement, and identification of issues such as file corruption, security vulnerabilities, and more.

Issues Inherent in This Infrastructure:

SSL Termination Challenge:
A concern arises from terminating SSL at the load balancer level, as it would render traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted. This vulnerability could expose sensitive data during the intermediate phase of transmission.

Single MySQL Server Limitation:
Relying solely on a single MySQL server presents scalability challenges and poses a single point of failure risk for the entire web infrastructure. This configuration hampers the ability to accommodate growth and elevates the risk of downtime in case of server failures.

Uniform Components Impact:
The presence of identical components across servers introduces resource contention issues, including competition for resources like CPU, memory, and I/O. This can lead to suboptimal performance and complicate troubleshooting efforts. Moreover, this uniform setup does not lend itself well to seamless scalability.
